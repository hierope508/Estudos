        <p>Drop caps - making the first letter of a paragraph or document much larger than the rest of the text - has been a stylistic element of typography for hundreds of years. In classic hand-written manuscripts you'll often find drop caps turned into elaborate works of art often taking up a significant area of the page providing illustrations supporting the material of the text itself.</p>
        <p>The drop cap is a great visual tool to notify the reader "this is the beginning of a defined portion of text." That said, using drop caps introduces accessibility issues as they can make it more difficult to read the first word.</p>
