        With flex and grid in place, I often get asked if float and clear are
        still relevant. The answer is of course they are! And now, for the first
        time, we get to use them the way they were intended to be used.
      </p>
      <h2>Control with clear</h2>
      <p>
        The float property places an item to the left or right side of its
        parent container by removing it from the normal flow of the page and
        literally floating it in its context. The remaining elements in the same
        parent container flow or float around the floated container filling up
        the available space. In a text editor we call this text wrap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we float an item, it is often necessary to control what other items
        can appear next to it. That’s where the clear property comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the good old days of float-based layouts, we used clear as part of a
        clearfix to ensure containers didn’t collapse, and this introduced quite
        a bit of confusion about what the clear property is actually for, so let
        me explain:
      </p>
      <p>
        If you apply clear: right to an item, you are saying “nothing can appear
        - or float - to the right of this item” and adjacent siblings are
        literally cleared away from the space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clear left prevents adjacent siblings from appearing on the left, clear
        right on the right, and clear both clears both sides.
